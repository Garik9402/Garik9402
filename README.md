  <h2>About me</h2>
🤟I'm a big fan of BEM, Lea Verou, Vanilla JS.<br/> 
💡I often start developing services for myself or people close to me.<br/>
🌱Just as GitHub expanded the world, I would like to contribute to a future in which the world is enriched by people who gradually support each other.<br/>
🪘 I play folk percussion instruments.<br/>
🎼 I spend my free time on creativity, as immersion in music gives me strength and inspiration for more interesting projects.
